# Algorithmic-Investment-Platform-Trading-Bot---Backend

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for an algorithmic trading system consisting of multiple modules. The system includes functionality for generating trading signals, implementing risk management strategies, using benchmark data for comparison, and visualizing the portfolio's performance. This project was created during freshman semester using techniques learned in OOP class and a lot of youtube coding videos as well as finance / trading strategies textbooks from CULC.

## Files

1. **main.py**: The main script that orchestrates the entire trading system. It integrates functionalities from `risk_management.py`, `benchmark.py`, and `portfolio_visualization.py` to create a comprehensive algorithmic trading system.

2. **risk_management.py**: This script focuses on risk management strategies for the trading system. It includes functions to calculate position sizes, set stop-loss levels, and manage risk per trade.

3. **benchmark.py**: A script dedicated to handling benchmark data. It includes functions to fetch benchmark data, calculate benchmark returns, and compare the trading system's performance with benchmark performance.

4. **portfolio_visualization.py**: A module for visualizing the trading system's portfolio performance. It includes functions for plotting key metrics, such as equity curve, drawdowns, and other performance indicators.
